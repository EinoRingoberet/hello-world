# hello-world
The first repository of a GitHub Noob

I'm Eino.
I love to practice something and my current hobbies are riding motorcicles at a riders' school and playing an electric bass.
As you notice, I'm not an English native speaker(Japanese) so I hope to white and communicate in English through coding from now on.
